            <p class="modal-text">Howdy! My name is Edward Eiche and I come from Republic, Missouri. 
              I’m a junior aerospace engineering student here at Texas A&M and I’ve been a part of ASS 
              since January 2023 and have loved every second of it! I love to hike/backpack both domestically 
              and abroad, and running/trail running wherever I am currently based. </p>
            <p class="modal-text">I have truly found my kind of people through ASS. Growing up I gravitated toward 
              all things outdoors, leading me to make great friends through Boy Scouts and going on camping/backpacking/portaging 
              trips with my friends as often as possible. Coming to A&M, I struggled my first semester to balance 
              school with the more fulfilling parts of my life (as in anything outdoor related). 
              In the spring of my freshman year I decided to be more intentional in dedicating more time to this area of my 
              life I desperately missed. I had been introduced to ASS during Howdy week but only went to the first and last
              meetings of the fall semester. I have never been part of such a wonderfully fun, thoughtful, and supportive group. Everyone in the organization shares my 
              same sense of curiosity and adventure, delving into the depths of the earth but also spending lots of time with each other 
              above ground. I have ASS to thank for some of the closest friends I have made in college, and it has taught me skills that 
              I need to thrive in the caving community.</p>
            <p class="modal-text">One thing you wished people knew about caving: <b>That the barrier to entry is so low!</b> All you’ve gotta do 
              is reach out to some known cavers (like ASS!) and chances are they would love to take you on a trip and show you the ropes 
              (sometimes literally). The caving community loves to bring in new blood and all you’ve gotta do is ask!</p>

            <p class="modal-text">Howdy, I’m Drew, the current Social Media and Outreach officer. 
            I’ve been a member of the Aggie Grotto since Fall of 2021. 
            I’m currently a senior at Texas A&M studying Geology. 
            I first became aware of caving through stories I had seen on TV and through social media. 
            While I had been in a few show caves, I had always wanted to experience “wild” caving, 
            and was instantly drawn to the Aggie Grotto when I found out that it existed. </p>

            <p class="modal-text">The first cave I ever went to with ASS was Whirlpool, which was an exciting 
            and somewhat nerve wracking experience as I was unsure if I would enjoy it. 
            However, the second I got underground I instantly fell in love with caving.. 
            I had an incredible time traversing the cave, taking pictures, and talking with my fellow cavers. 
            Ever since I’ve been hooked on caving and the incredible community that surrounds it. 
            Outside of caving, I like hiking, camping, rockhounding, climbing, weightlifting, 
            gaming and ceramics.</p>
