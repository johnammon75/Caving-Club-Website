            <p class="modal-text">Howdy! My name is Edward Eiche and I come from Republic, Missouri. 
              I’m a junior aerospace engineering student here at Texas A&M and I’ve been a part of ASS 
              since January 2023 and have loved every second of it! I love to hike/backpack both domestically 
              and abroad, and running/trail running wherever I am currently based. </p>
            <p class="modal-text">I have truly found my kind of people through ASS. Coming to A&M, I struggled my first semester to balance 
              school with the more fulfilling parts of my life (as in anything outdoor related). 
              In the spring of my freshman year I decided to be more intentional in dedicating more time to this area of my 
              life I desperately missed. I had been introduced to ASS during Howdy week but only went to the first and last
              meetings of the fall semester. I have never been part of such a wonderfully fun, thoughtful, and supportive group. Everyone in the organization shares my 
              same sense of curiosity and adventure, delving into the depths of the earth but also spending lots of time with each other 
              above ground. I have ASS to thank for some of the closest friends I have made in college, and it has taught me skills that 
              I need to thrive in the caving community.</p>
            <p class="modal-text">One thing you wished people knew about caving: <b>That the barrier to entry is so low!</b> All you’ve gotta do 
              is reach out to some known cavers (like ASS!) and chances are they would love to take you on a trip and show you the ropes 
              (sometimes literally). The caving community loves to bring in new blood and all you’ve gotta do is ask!</p>

            <p class="modal-text">Howdy, I’m Drew, the current Social Media and Outreach officer. 
            I’ve been a member of the Aggie Grotto since Fall of 2021. 
            I’m currently a senior at Texas A&M studying Geology. 
            I first became aware of caving through stories I had seen on TV and through social media. 
            While I had been in a few show caves, I had always wanted to experience “wild” caving, 
            and was instantly drawn to the Aggie Grotto when I found out that it existed. </p>

            <p class="modal-text">The first cave I ever went to with ASS was Whirlpool, which was an exciting 
            and somewhat nerve wracking experience as I was unsure if I would enjoy it. 
            However, the second I got underground I instantly fell in love with caving.. 
            I had an incredible time traversing the cave, taking pictures, and talking with my fellow cavers. 
            Ever since I’ve been hooked on caving and the incredible community that surrounds it. 
            Outside of caving, I like hiking, camping, rockhounding, climbing, weightlifting, 
            gaming and ceramics.</p>

              President. I was introduced to caving through A.S.S. in 2022, and quickly fell for the experience,
              education, and friendship fostered through this organization. From my first wild caving trip in Whirlpool
              to caving internationally in Mexico, I have been so blessed to grow exponentially and be embraced by
              this community. I want to cultivate an environment that encourages future Aggies to have similar
              experiences through providing numerous opportunities to learn about anything cave &amp; karst.
              My primary goal as your president is to strengthen the basis of our standards so we may
              continue to introduce the wonders of the subterranean to new individuals while encouraging the
              growth of our senior membership into well-rounded young cavers. We are developing the next
              generation of cavers, and instilling the core values of safety, conservation, and scientific exploration will
              be at the forefront of everything we do this year. A.S.S. is truly one-of-a-kind, and I can’t wait to
              continue making memories together.

              pursuing a B.S. in Industrial Engineering with a minor in project management. I am personally excited to
              continue developing my leadership skills guiding the grotto to new leads of success this year, as well as
              expanding my knowledge as a caver. After graduating this May, I plan to work in reliability and resource

              I’m pursuing both a Bachelor's degree in Accounting and a Masters in Financial Management. I
              found ASS by just pulling up a list of the orgs and clubs on campus and joining it was one of, if
              not the best choices I’ve made. I had always been interested in caves due to both my
              fascination with bats and my admittedly equal fascination with Batman. These interests
              combined with a desire for adventure and a love of the outdoors led to me joining and through
              this club I have made some of my favorite memories, met some of my favorite people, and have
              even been able to utilize my experiences within it to make career advancements.</p>
            <p class="modal-text"> As treasurer, I hope to ensure the financial wellbeing of the club both now and in the future
              years to come, and to use some of the things I’ve learned throughout my coursework to improve
              the position as well as our continued prosperity. I’m incredibly proud to be able to represent a
              club that allows people to have fun, forge friendships, and even help to protect and conserve
              these underground habitats through the activity of caving, and I hope that I’m able to give a little
              back to the club that has given me so much.</p>
